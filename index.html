			<blockquote>Look no further&hellip;Teresa is a wonderful host and her accommodation is fantastic. Her accommodation is located in a quiet section of Chestnut Hill, but short walking distance to all of the shops on Germantown Avenue. The accommodation was spacious, nicely appointed, and well maintained. The apartment was spotless and the bed extremely comfortable. You could not find a better place to stay if you want to outside Center City, but want easy access and the charm of Chestnut Hill.</blockquote>
			<blockquote>stayed in a studio suite at Anam Cara Accommodations from the beginning of February through most of April while recuperating from eye surgery and relocating to Philadelphia. From my experiences, this is an excellent, and more charming and convenient, alternative to a Hilton Homewood Suites/Home2 or a Marriott Residence Inn/Townplace/SpringHill, if you won't mind missing their meals, the daily room service, or the fitness center.</blockquote>
			<blockquote>The furnishings were very comfortable. My suite included a queen(?) size bed with an extra single bed in a curtained, separate area that also served as a small library of books and videos. There was a small desk and a leather club chair that reclined. The kitchen was well stocked with an eclectic collection of dishes, cookware, and appliances for preparing meals. The dining room area was separate from both the kitchen and the sleeping/living room areas. The bathroom had a vintage tub and plush towels, plus amenities, such as fragrant soaps and a hair dryer. The cable tv service provided a nice selection of channels. Complimentary WIFI was available. A washer and a dryer were in the basement, and use of them, along with the detergent, was complimentary. The entryway to the building was attractively decorated and had plenty of helpful information for guests who are unfamiliar with the area.</blockquote>
			<blockquote>I appreciated the convenience of not having to navigate stairs, except when I did my laundry.</blockquote>
			<blockquote>The house is located in the Chestnut Hill Historic District, and the area is quiet. The SEPTA commuter train station (service into 30th Street Station and Center City) was a short walk of about 2 blocks. The very frequent #23 bus service on Germantown Avenue was about 4 blocks away in the opposite direction. Germantown Avenue has great restaurants and shops. Anam Cara is not far the from the Weavers Way Co-op, the US Post Office, and Staples.</blockquote>
			<blockquote>Teresa was a wonderful host, checking in regularly and attending to any details, but giving me the privacy that I wanted. There was cleaning service available at an extra charge, although I chose to do my own housekeeping because the cleaning products and equipment were available. The security deposit was returned promptly.</blockquote>
			<blockquote>I enjoyed my time here and would definitely choose Anam Cara Accommodations again!</blockquote>
			<blockquote>As a travel nurse who lives in a new city every 3 to 6 months, i depend on safe, clean, furnished, pet friendly housing often. As one can imagine over a 7 year period a weary, unfamiliar traveler can find a gem or pure garbage. In the Chestnut Hill area of Philadelphia, I found a gem.<br>Teresa was amazing from the very start. We met, discussed my needs and how they may change according to the hospitals needs. We were able to come to an amicable agreement quickly. When the hospital changed a few things around, Teresa was very cooperative and supportive.<br>The apartments are wonderful. They are stocked with basic household items, including dishes, pots and pans, silverware. They also have not so basic items like over-sized, fluffy, soft, super comfy comforters and blankets and sheets that feel like silk against your skin. Extra towels and start up paper products were also available. Cable with several Showtime, Epic and Cinemax and free wifi were also very nice. And I also simply loved the rocking chair!!!<br>The neighborhood is very pet friendly with a park, community center and dog walking company within walking distance. I felt very safe in the neighborhood, even when walking my dog alone at night. The neighbors are very friendly and even helped me shovel snow from the sidewalk and around my car after I broke the shovel (it was quite an experience :-D) during a snow storm Stella.<br>I highly recommend these apartments and would gladly stay there again if I ever returned to Philadelphia. Anam Cara and Teresa did not feel like an extended stay and owner, it truly felt like being at home with a friend.</blockquote>
